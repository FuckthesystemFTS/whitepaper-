        <h1>FTS Token - Whitepaper</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>FTS (Fuck The System) is more than just a tokenâ€”it's a movement. Rooted in the original values of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, FTS is a rallying cry for decentralization, autonomy, and resistance against the monopolistic systems that dominate the financial world. FTS represents Digital Resistance, embodying defiance and change.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>FTS Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Empower Financial Autonomy:</b> FTS operates as a truly decentralized token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), free from the influence of centralized entities.</li>
                <li><b>Foster Active Participation:</b> Innovative mechanisms for token distribution and burning encourage community involvement and incentivize participation.</li>
                <li><b>Achieve Sustainable Growth:</b> Using controlled "burn" mechanisms, FTS ensures long-term scarcity, protecting token value and combating inflation.</li>
                <li><b>Promote Sustainability:</b> By supporting sustainable mining farms, FTS integrates eco-conscious principles, reducing its environmental footprint while driving adoption.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Sustainable Mining Initiative</h2>
            <p>FTS goes beyond being a token; it's a driver of innovation in crypto mining. The project invests in sustainable mining farms powered by renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimize the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate that decentralization and sustainability can coexist.</li>
                <li>Set a new standard for responsible blockchain ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Token Distribution and Allocation</h2>
            <p>The total supply of FTS tokens is 100 billion, with a maximum burn of 50% of the total supply to ensure scarcity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Airdrop and Airburn Phase (30%):</b> For every token distributed during the airdrop, one token is burned, ensuring deflation and community engagement.</li>
                <li><b>Play to Win and Play for Burn (20%):</b> Gamified distribution incentivizes user participation, with one token burned for every two tokens distributed.</li>
                <li><b>Remaining 50% of Supply:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>5% to the CEO's Project</li>
                        <li>5% to the FTS Team</li>
                        <li>10% for Project Development</li>
                        <li>10% to the BRI Community</li>
                        <li>10% for Marketing and Investments</li>
                        <li>10% for Future Projects</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
